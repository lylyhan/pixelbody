# we walked aimlessly in a room filled up by people, filling up holes in between us.
# we looked at each other and smiled, some you know at certain instant you were gonna hug them, others just passerby, either you’re too distracted or they’re insecure
# we were at this moment of consensus and non-verbal agreement
# decisions are made sans mot
# we hugged and listened to each others’ heartbeat
# in a rare occasion under the roof that used to be a sweatshop
# what does it mean to you, my body
# if i were to listen to your heartbeat will i cry
# will i still cry
# am i listening to the wrong side of your chest
# is that a gesture for the sake of a gesture
# am i really listening, are you?
# i know she was
# what did she hear
# on top of layers of sweaters
# does it make a difference
